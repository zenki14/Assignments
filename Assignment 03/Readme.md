___This homework is due by 8am, on 01/12/2015___

### Surf & Paddle

Your homework today is to recreate the Surf and Paddle mockup (surf-paddle.png).

All of the assets you should need are located in the `/assets` folder. 

This needs to be as pixel perfect as you can make it. To help with this you can use the Chrome Plugin, [PerfectPixel](http://www.welldonecode.com/perfectpixel/). I will be overlaying the mockup to check your homework.

You should also use [Normalize CSS](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)

Also, you will need to utilize [Google Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts)

This homework is due Monday (01.12.15) morning by 8am and should be uploaded to your Github account titled "Surf_Paddle" and you should leave a comment on the Github issue assigned to you that points to that Repo.

Use this live mockup to match the centering [here](http://h.timw.co/code/surf/)
