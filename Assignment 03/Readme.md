___This homework is due by 8am, on 01/12/2015___

### Surf & Paddle

Your homework today is to recreate the Surf and Paddle mockup (surf-paddle.png).

All of the assets you should need are located in the `/assets` folder. 

This needs to be as pixel perfect as you can make it. To help with this you can use the Chrome Plugin, [PerfectPixel](http://www.welldonecode.com/perfectpixel/). I will be overlaying the mockup to check your homework.

You should also use [Normalize CSS](http://necolas.github.io/normalize.css/)

Also, you will need to utilize [Google Fonts](http://www.google.com/fonts)

This homework is due Monday (01.12.15) morning by 8am and should be uploaded to your Github account titled "Surf_Paddle" and you should leave a comment on the Github issue assigned to you that points to that Repo.

Use this live mockup to match the centering [here](http://h.timw.co/code/surf/)

### Bonus

1. Make it responsive. 
2. Use the PDF to see what the responsive mockup looks like

We've not talked about how to make things responsive yet, but if you are interested in working ahead, go for it.

We will spend time on RWD (responsive web design) in this course, but it is generally beyond the scope of the first week.

#### A few hints

1. Use `%`'s instead of `px` widths
2. Use break points - read more about them [here](http://alistapart.com/article/responsive-web-design)
