___This homework is due by 8am, on 01/13/15___

## Homework

1. Read over this [style guide](https://github.com/necolas/idiomatic-css)
2. Create a `sass` branch of Surf & Paddle
3. Setup a `.scss` file in that branch and convert your project to using SASS
4. Follow the above style guide
5. There should not be any ID's in your CSS.
6. All colors, font families, fixed width sizes etc should be in variables.
7. Any reusable rules should be converted to mixins
8. Make sure to use nesting, but don't go too deep

## Deliverables

When you are done with the above, you should merge your `sass` branch into your `master` branch. From there you should branch off and create a branch called `gh-pages`.

When you are complete, please comment on the open issue with a link to your GH Pages for this project as well as a link to the SASS file `.scss` you used for this project.

1. Slice up and recreate the image (blueprint.png)
2. Use SASS
3. The font is [Lato](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Lato)
4. Use any icons you want for inside the circles
5. Other than the icons, do not use any images at all
6. Set up a GH-Pages branch for this and link to it in the comments
